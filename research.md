## Research Interests 
My research interests are Mathematical Logic and its connections with Combinatorics and Ramsey Theory. In particular, the 

  * [Partition regularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_regularity) of polynomial equations.
  * [Nonstandard models of arithmetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_model_of_arithmetic) and their applications to [Ramsey Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_theory).
  * [Čech–Stone compactification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%E2%80%93%C4%8Cech_compactification) of [semigroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup) and its algebraic and combinatorial properties.
