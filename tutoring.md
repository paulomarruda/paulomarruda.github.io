Welcome to my tutoring page. Here you'll find information about my tutoring classes on both mathematics and programming.

### How it works
To make sure you get the most out of each tutoring session, here's how my process works:

  1. **Send Materials in Advance**: Before each session, please send any relevant materials (exercise sheets, homework assignments, bibliographies, or topics you'd like to cover). This helps me prepare a tailored lesson plan, ensuring we make the best use of our time together. To get the most effective results, I ask that you send these materials at least 48 hours in advance. (Please note: *Sending materials the day before an exam may not allow enough time for thorough preparation!*)

  2. **Programming Lessons**: If you're want to learn how to code, I can tailor our sessions to your real-world needs. Please send me examples of the challenges or projects you encounter in your daily student/work life. This allows me to create sessions focused on practical, relevant solutions that you can immediately apply in your career.

  2. **Customized Lesson Plan**: Once I receive your materials, I’ll review them and prepare a structured plan for our session. This ensures that we focus on the areas where you need the most support, whether it’s clarifying difficult concepts, solving exercises, or preparing for an upcoming test.

  3. **Tutoring Sessions**: During our session, we’ll work through the material step by step. I’ll explain concepts, answer your questions, and provide guidance on how to approach problems. Whether it’s foundational learning or advanced topics, my goal is to make the material clear and approachable.

  4. **Follow-up and Support**: After each session, if you have further questions or need clarification, feel free to reach out! I’m here to support you in your learning journey.

### Who am I
Backed by 11 years of teaching, tutoring, and educational research, I am passionate about helping students and professionals achieve their academic and professional goals. I first began tutoring during my undergraduate studies, providing lessons in math and programming to high school and university students. My early teaching experience included tutoring in basic programming and Linux, as well as teaching university-level exercise classes in subjects like calculus, linear algebra, real analysis, logic, and topology.

Currently, as a PhD student at the University of Vienna, I continue to combine my research with my passion for education. I was honored to receive the prestigious Marietta Blau Grant, which allowed me to implement my research project in cooperation with the University of Vienna. This blend of academic research and real-world application has given me a deep understanding of how to teach complex subjects in a clear, engaging way.

Whether you’re a student looking to improve your grades or a professional aiming to advance your skills, I tailor each session to your unique learning style and goals. My approach is friendly, didactic, and designed to ensure that you not only understand the material but excel in applying it.

Let’s work together to achieve your goals, whether academic or professional, with personalized, effective tutoring.
